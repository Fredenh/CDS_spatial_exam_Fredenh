# Spatial Analytics digital product
This is the combined code and outputs of the digital product for the Spatial Analytics course in Cultural Data Science

# Abstract
The amount of forest fire not only in Italy, but the whole world, has increased since the 1980s as a result of the Anthropocene climate crisis. The code within this repository seeks to help tourists if they are caught in a wildfire by providing a pipeline that takes in a geolocation and calculates isochrones for reachable areas by driving, cycling and walking in 15 minutes. The effect of this is to simulate a scenario where one is trapped and public transport is unavailable.
This is achieved through spataial visualizations like raster point maps and interactive leaflet maps. Statistics on overall tourism is also visualized in order to maximize the potential of a simulation from a heavily touristed location.

# Software framework
The code for this project was carried out on my 64-bit Windows stationary computer with 8 GB RAM and a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-12100F 3.30 GHz processor. 
The code is written in one programming language which is R (4.2.3). The R programming language provides the software package RStudio (v2023.03.1+446 Spotted Wakerobin) in which the code for this assignment has been carried out.

# Contents 
There are four folders in this repository:
* _data_ is where the data used in the code is stored
* _figs_ is where the non-spatial visualizations are stored (line- and bar plot)
* _maps_ is where the spatial visualizations are stored
* _code_ is where the main pipeline of R code is located and its knitted html document

# Usage
Firstly, make sure you have these libraries in order to run the code:
